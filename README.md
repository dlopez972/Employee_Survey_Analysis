Employee Survey Analysis

For our Employee Survey Analysis we'll break the project into three steps
 
 Step 1: EDA
  - loading our data into our working environment
  - load necessary packages for project
  - understanding our data (dimensions/rows & columns/data types etc.)
  
  
  Step 2: Data Transformation
  - Should know which transformations are needed based on above step
  - Applying data transformation steps into new dataframe
  - Checking results for desired outcome
  
  Steps 3: Data Analysis
  - Estimating internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's Alpha (ensuring there's intercorrelation among results by theme)
  - Creating a composite variable based on a multi-item measure (aggregating scores by theme)
